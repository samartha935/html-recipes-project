    <p>Saag paneer is a classic Indian dish of cooked spinach studded with cubes of fried paneer cheese. Thickened with
        cream or coconut milk, it's a hearty and filling vegetarian meal.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Ingredients.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 bunches spinach, roughly chopped.</li>
        <li>1 bunch fenugreek leaves, roughly chopped.</li>
        <li>Â½ pound paneer, cubed.</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds.</li>
        <li>1 onion, thinly sliced.</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced.</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger.</li>
        <li>1 tomato, diced.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Directions.</h3>

    <b>Step 1</b>
    <p>Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil; add spinach and fenugreek and cook until wilted, about 3 minutes.
        Drain well; transfer to a food processor and blend until finely chopped, about 5 pulses.</p>

    <b>Step 2</b>
    <p>Heat 1 tablespoon canola oil in a large skillet over medium heat; add paneer cubes and fry until browned on all
        sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer paneer onto a plate.</p>

    <b>Step 3</b>
    <p>Heat remaining 2 tablespoons canola oil in the same skillet over medium heat; add cumin seeds and fry until
        lightly toasted and aromatic, about 3 minutes. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Add
        garlic and ginger and stir to coat. Stir in tomato, garam masala, turmeric, and cayenne pepper; cook until
        tomato breaks down, stirring often, about 10 minutes.</p>

    <b>Step 4</b>
    <p>Stir in pureed spinach mixture, paneer cubes, and cream; add salt to taste. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer
        for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p>
